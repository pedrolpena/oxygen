Part descriptions and orientations:
O2 titration apparatus: the body that holds the stepper motor and syringe used to dispense the sodium thiosulfate for the titration process; the syringe unit faces the front of the apparatus, sticking out of the center cylinder and out the top of the top pieces (top piece 1, top piece 2, protector piece); some pieces have recessed holes to allow screws to sit into the apparatus without sticking out; it is oriented so that the recessed holes on the flat rectangular piece face down on the table and the curvature of the other piece connecting to the stir plate matches the curvature of the stir plate
 - O2 Base Plate: this piece is the base of the O2 titration apparatus and connects to the stir plate; thought it is technically two pieces, the pieces fit into one another and are held together by magnets; the magnets slide into the slotted holes on each piece; the stepper motor sits on top of this piece; it is connected to the Syringe Holder and stir plate using 8-32 screws
 - O2 Protector: this piece sits on top of Top 1 and Top 2; the top cylinder piece faces with the open side the same direction as the syringe unit (allowing you to still be able to read the numbers on the syringe); 8-32 screws pass through the top of this piece into the top pieces and connects to the Syringe Holder; it is oriented that the flat square base sits on top of the top pieces and the opening on the cylinder faces towards the front of the apparatus (same direction as the Syringe Holder opening on the cylinder)
 - O2 Syringe Holder: this piece sits on top of the stepper motor and holds the syringe inside the center cylinder; it is connected to the O2 Base Plate and the Top pieces (Top 1, Top 2, Protector) using 8-32 screws; it is oriented so that the flat square base sits on top of the stepper motor and the opening on the cylinder faces towards the front of the apparatus
 - O2 Top 1: this piece sits on top of the Syringe Holder at the front of the apparatus; the syringe passes through the circle that is made by both top pieces coming together; it is connected to the Syringe Holder, Top 2, and Protector using 8-32 screws; it is oriented that the recessed holes face the front of the apparatus 
 - O2 Top 2: this piece sits on top of the Syringe Holder at the back of the apparatus; the syringe passes through the circle that is made by both top pieces coming together and the pin passes through the center hole; it is connected to the Syringe Holder, Top 1, and Protector using 8-32 screws; it is oriented that the semicircle creates a full circle with Top 1 and the Syringe Holder cylinder top fits into the bottom side recessed partial circle 

	
O2 connector pieces: these pieces connect the O2 titration apparatus to the stir plate and the stir plate to the electrode 
 - O2 Tubing Valve: this piece is used to hold the valve that switches the flow of thiosulfate in the tubing of the oxygen apparatus; this piece uses an 8-32 screw to secure itself to the valve switch mechanical piece; there are two 4-40 screw holes; it is oriented so that the piece lays flat on the 3D printer plate
 - O2 Pole Holder: this piece is used to hold the pole (and its counterparts) to the stir plate; the stir plate is connected to this piece using 4-40 screws (the screws pass from inside the stir plate into the Pole Holder ); it is oriented vertically so that the completely flat side is facing down onto the table 
 - O2 Electrode Holder rest: this piece passes through the pole and sits underneath the Electrode Holder to keep the electrode in place; the Bolt Nut is used to tighten this piece to the pole; it is oriented so the four groves are facing up when on the pole 
 - O2 Electrode Holder: this piece passes through the pole and sits on top of the Electrode Holder rest; there are two pole holes (close together) for different orientations of oxygen titration setups; the electrode passes through the front hole and sits into the recessed hole; the plastic tubing can pass through either small hole next to the electrode hole depending on oxygen titration setup orientation; this pieces allows you to move the electrode in out of samples easily; it is oriented so that the triangular bottom is facing down on the pole and sits into the four groves on the Electrode Holder rest 
 - O2 Bolt Nut: this piece has a recessed hole that allows an 8-32 screw to pass through and sit in the piece; there is another recessed hole on the opposite side from a nut to hold the screw in place; the screw from then screws into the Electrode Holder rest to secure the Electrode Holder rest to the pole 


 
 Print Orientations (recommend enabling default tree (auto) support with a threshold angle of 30 for each piece):
 - O2 Base Plate: the rectangular piece is printed with it's long and thin side on the printing plate so that the slotted hole and small rectangular pieces are vertical; the other piece is printed so that the slotted hole is facing straight up
